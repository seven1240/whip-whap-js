# WHIP-WHAP-JS: WebRTC WHIP and WHAP support in a short single JS file



## WHIP
WHIP stands for WebRTC-HTTP ingestion protocol
It's an IETF draft, and you can learn more here:
https://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-wish-whip-01.html

## WHAP
WHIP stands for WebRTC-HTTP access protocol
And this is the only place to learn about it for now.

## Features
- Auto-retries WHIP/WHAP on WebRTC failure, or when iceConnectionState is "disconnected"
